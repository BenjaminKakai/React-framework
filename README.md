**#React Installation on Ubuntu**

This guide will walk you through the steps to install React on an Ubuntu machine.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, you need to have the following software installed on your machine:

Node.js
npm (Node Package Manager)
To install Node.js and npm, run the following commands in your terminal:

csharp
Copy code
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
Verify that Node.js and npm are installed by running the following commands:

Copy code
node -v
npm -v
Installing React
To install React, run the following command in your terminal:

lua
Copy code
npm install -g create-react-app
This will install the create-react-app package globally on your machine, which can be used to create new React projects.

Creating a React Project
To create a new React project, run the following command in your terminal:

lua
Copy code
npx create-react-app my-app
Replace my-app with the name of your project. This command will create a new directory with the name my-app and set up a basic React project inside it.

Running the React Project
To run the React project, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

bash
Copy code
cd my-app
npm start
This will start a development server and open the React application in your browser at http://localhost:3000. You should now see a basic React application running on your machine.

With these steps, you should have successfully installed and created a React project on your Ubuntu machine. Happy coding!
